# The Landing Page

The simple Landing page.

## GitHub Pages

You can create personal websites using GitHub Pages. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to know how or follow the steps below.

If you already have a GitHub profile:

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Cool! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`
